		<h1>Raccoons</h1>
		<p>Raccoons are opportunistic, intelligent creatures that have adapted well to our urban and suburban 
        landscapes. A general lack of predators combined with easy to access food sources such as garbage
        cans, compost bins, gardens and outdoor pet food bowls have allowed raccoons to proliferate even 
        in the most developed of areas.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Raccoons are primarily nocturnal animals but can be seen at any time of day. Adult raccoons in the Pacific Northwest typically range in weight between 10 and 25 pounds but can get larger.</li>
            <li>They are omnivorous and consume a highly varied diet that includes fruit and vegetables, insects, small rodents, fish and human handouts, as well as pet food and garbage when available.</li>
            <li>Raccoons typically den above ground in tree cavities and under downed logs, but will substitute chimneys, attics and crawlspaces where available. Breeding season in the Pacific Northwest extends from early March through early fall. Litters can range from 1-7 kits. Young are weaned at about 2 months of ages but may remain with the mother through the first winter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Reducing Human-Raccoon Conflicts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Do not feed raccoons:</b> Deliberate feeding of raccoons makes them more comfortable around humans and more likely to get into situations where they are unwanted or in danger. It also encourages unnaturally high population levels within a small geographic area, which creates a higher risk of disease transmission among the raccoons and increases the likelihood they will become pests.</li>
            <li><b>Feed pets indoors:</b> This will eliminate a raccoon attractant and will diminish the likelihood of an unwanted encounter between your pet and a wild animal.</li>
            <li><b>Tightly cover all garbage cans.</b> Use bungees or other methods for securing the lids if necessary.
            Seal up all potential denning locations within your home: Placing caps on chimneys and blocking outside entryways to basements, attics, and under porches will reduce the likelihood that you will wind up sharing your home with a raccoon.</li>
            <li><b>Naturescape for wildlife:</b> Plant native vegetation and leave snags standing. Making natural food and shelter available will reduce the likelihood of unwanted human-raccoon interactions.
            Raccoons are not pets! Raccoons do not make good pets. Like all wild animals, raccoons can carry diseases and parasites. When they reach sexual maturity, they can become territorial and aggressive. It is illegal in the State of Oregon to take a raccoon out of the wild to be kept as a pet.</li>

        <h2>Common Situations or Concerns</h2> 
        <h3>A “nuisance” raccoon</h3>
        <p>Raccoons are a fact of urban living. In many cases, tolerance and prevention (eliminating unnatural food sources, sealing up potential denning locations) is the best approach. If you do find yourself in conflict with your local raccoon population, the first thing to consider is identifying the source of the problem. What is attracting the raccoon to your property?

        <b>Is there a way to eliminate the attractant?</b> Do you need to speak with your neighbors about doing the same? The vast majority of urban raccoon conflicts occur because somebody in the neighborhood is either deliberately or inadvertently providing some sort of unnatural food source for the raccoons.</p>
